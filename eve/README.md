# eve folder
Eve is just picked from the film 'WALL.E' that I love most. And in this folder, I will place the mobile ui project.

# eve tech stack
Until now, I will use the react to build the mobile ui, but that not the final solution, maybe I will change it in the future.
1. react
2. webpack
3. mocha
4. npm

# eve pattern

This is some of the patter that be used in this project.

1. dir: singular words
2. file: singular and complex words
3. test: test file in `__test__` dir and end with Test
4. do not using ()=> in UT test it will lead can not access to mocha context.
5. all dependency should using absolute path to require `src/...`.
6. remenber to add flow type
7. when is doing card, remember to name branch as [card-name] and every commit should like this [card-name] - descriptions.
