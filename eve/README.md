# eve folder
Eve is just picked from the film 'WALL.E' that I love most. And in this folder, I will place the mobile ui project.

# eve tech stack
Until now, I will use the react to build the mobile ui, but that not the final solution, maybe I will change it in the future.
1. react
2. webpack
3. mocha
4. npm
