# Depoma Repo

As you may wander what is this repository, and the meaning of it's name. So here I gonna tell you all of that.
First, this repo is a collection of my diploma, and it store the codebase and doc.
Second, The name of 'Depoma' is just an alias of diploma.

# Depoma Thinking

As I have confirmed with my mentor that my diploma is wechat robot that can automatically recognize user's word and tell him the resource that he want.
And as the thinking talking above, we need those tech stack so that my diploma can go live.

1. Data mining (So that I can prepare the data from user)
2. Deep learning (So that I can sent the correct content that the user want)
3. Wechat bridge (So that I can communicate to wechat user)
4. Back end tech (Like Java Web or Python Web so that I can set up a web service)
5. Front end tech (Like React so that I can set up a user interface)
6. Test Flow (As I wanna design this depoma as a production ready product so I need a test chain to ensure the quality like UT, E2E)
7. DevOps tech (So that I can operate my diploma in a production ready environment)

# Depoma Plans

As mentor has no plan, so I should make my plan by myself.

1. Make a UI using react (as now you are just learning react)

# Branch Introduce

This is just a branch introduce so that I can track my thought of branch in the feature.

1. [master] This brach is a stable branch and it passed test. And it can be deployed to environment directly.
2. [dev] This branch is not stable and it just passed part test. And we can merge other developing branch to this branch and then merge this branch to master when pass all the test.
3. [developing branch] This branch is not really exist I should name the branch by the function or action that I just wanna to develop. And you can merge this branch to dev when complete the development and pass test like UT.
